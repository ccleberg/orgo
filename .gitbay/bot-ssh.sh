# Sourced by pages.sh and release.sh. The build runs in a container that
# holds no key of its own; the orgo-ci account's private key (write on this
# repository) arrives as the BOT_SSH_KEY secret and is written into the
# workspace beside an ssh config every ssh and git call is pointed at with
# -F. GITBAY_SSH, set by the runner, is the instance as this build reaches
# it. Nothing is written outside the workspace.
